# 🎄 Advent of Code: C & Java 🎅

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** challenge repository! This is my journey through 25 days of programming puzzles, where I'll solve each problem using **C** and **Java**. Think of it as a holiday-themed code workout—complete with bugs, caffeine, and the occasional festive meltdown. 🎁

---

## 🎯 Goal  
- **1 Puzzle a Day**: Solve each daily challenge from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
- **2 Languages**: Write solutions in **C** (for the raw, low-level grind) and **Java** (for the verbose elegance).
- **Keep it Fun**: Share my progress, struggles, and triumphs.
